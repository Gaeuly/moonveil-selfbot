## Project Description üìù

Moonveil-selfbot is a powerful and versatile Discord self-bot designed to enhance your Discord experience with over 500 commands. This self-bot provides a wide range of functionalities, from basic utility commands and fun interactions to advanced tools for server management and information gathering. It's built with JavaScript and utilizes the Discord.js library, providing a stable and efficient platform for extending your Discord capabilities.

This project aims to solve the need for users who desire more control and customization within Discord beyond what the standard client offers. While Discord bots are common, a self-bot operates directly within your user account, granting access to features and data that normal bots cannot access. However, it's crucial to understand that self-bots violate Discord's Terms of Service and their use carries a risk of account suspension or termination. This project is primarily intended for educational purposes and for use in development environments where such restrictions are not applicable.

Moonveil-selfbot is targeted towards experienced Discord users and developers who are comfortable with JavaScript and have a strong understanding of the potential risks involved with self-bots. It provides a rich set of commands and functionalities for those who wish to explore the possibilities of extending the Discord client. This self-bot serves as a powerful toolkit for automating tasks, retrieving information, and interacting with the Discord platform in a more personalized and efficient way, always with the caveat of responsible and informed usage.
