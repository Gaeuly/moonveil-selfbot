### Project Description üìù

Moonveil is a highly advanced, feature-rich Discord selfbot designed to provide extensive automation and utility directly within the user's client environment. Built on a foundation of modern JavaScript and utilizing the specialized `discord.js-selfbot-v13` library, this project aggregates over 500 distinct commands, positioning it as one of the most comprehensive toolkits available for power users seeking unparalleled control and efficiency on the platform.

The architecture emphasizes modularity and performance, integrating crucial dependencies to handle complex tasks seamlessly. This includes advanced media manipulation via `jimp` and QR code processing with `jsqr`, real-time data retrieval using `axios` and `cheerio` for scraping, and high-fidelity voice handling facilitated by `@discordjs/voice`, `opusscript`, and `libsodium-wrappers`. Furthermore, utility commands benefit from the precision of `mathjs` for calculations and `luxon` for accurate timestamp and date management.

Moonveil is structured to manage vast quantities of commands logically, organized into categories such as basic utilities, AI integration, fun, and advanced cloning features. While offering an exceptional degree of customization and power, the project serves as a technical demonstration of what can be achieved with selfbot architecture, providing a detailed framework for developers interested in complex Discord automation.

### Key Features ‚ú®

*   **Extensive Command Suite:** Over 500 categorized commands, including modules for AI interaction, data tracking, user statistics, and moderation utilities.
*   **Advanced Media Processing:** Capabilities for image resizing, manipulation, and metadata extraction using **Jimp**, alongside dedicated modules for reading and generating **QR codes** via **JSQR**.
*   **Deep Server & Asset Cloning:** Specialized commands (`cloneserver`, `cloneemoji`) allowing for the replication of server structures and assets, leveraging advanced scraping techniques.
*   **Real-Time Voice Interoperability:** Full support for joining and interacting within voice channels, utilizing the high-performance audio stack provided by **@discordjs/voice**, **opusscript**, and **libsodium-wrappers**.
